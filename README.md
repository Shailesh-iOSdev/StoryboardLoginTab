# StoryboardLoginTab
This demo demonstrates:
Show a list screen the first time the app is launched. When they visit this view, go to the first tab of the Tab Bar Controller.
Any time they launch the app after that, check if they have visited that screen, and skip straight to the first tab of the root Tab Bar Controller.
